**Local LLaMA Integration**

This project demonstrates the integration of Local LLaMA models into LangChain pipelines. It includes:

Setting up the Local LLaMA model.

Building a prompt-response system using LangChain.

Examples of fine-tuning and customization for specific tasks.

**Features**

Offline model execution.

High-performance inference.

Supports various Natural Language Processing (NLP) tasks.

**Chatbot Parser**

This project implements a chatbot parser to extract structured information from unstructured chat data. The parser can:

Process conversations.

Identify intents and entities.

Convert chat dialogues into structured formats (e.g., JSON, CSV).

**Features**

Easily customizable parsing rules.

Language-agnostic processing.

Integration with LangChain's conversational frameworks.

**OLLaMA Model Integrations**

The OLLaMA models provide specialized capabilities, and this project integrates these models into LangChain pipelines. It includes:

Pre-built tasks like summarization and translation.

Custom pipelines using OLLaMA-specific features.

Benchmarks comparing OLLaMA models with other LLMs.

**Features**

Optimized for multilingual tasks.

Flexible API for task-specific fine-tuning.

API Hosting for Local LLaMA Models

This project provides an API layer for hosting and interacting with Local LLaMA models. It allows users to:

Deploy LLaMA models as a service.

Interact with models using REST APIs.

Scale inference capabilities for production use.
